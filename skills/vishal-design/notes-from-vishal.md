# Notes from Vishal

Decisions and rules in Vishal's words, written down as he gave them. The skill in Stage 4 draws on this file. Nothing here is invented by an agent.

## Stage 1: visual language (confirmed 5 November 2026)

He confirmed the written description of his visual language is right, and answered three questions.

1. Accents. Keep five accent pairs from the site (soft tint plus deeper text colour, the `--w-*` and `--t-*` values) as a named palette. Rule: one accent per screen or product, never mixed. Keep the green live dot as its own status colour.

2. Headlines. Full heavy narrow treatment only for page titles and hero moments. On dense product screens use the same weight contrast at a smaller size, in one place per screen (a channel name, or a stat like "34 of 50 books"). Never in lists, messages or body content.

3. Two added rules.
   1. Buttons never lift or move on hover. Feedback is colour and press only.
   2. In dark mode, no dark on dark. Cards and panels must stay clearly separated from the background.

## Stage 2: tokens (decided 5 November 2026)

1. Accents. Use five: orange (the signature accent, from the home hero, wash `#FFE2CC`, text `#F07322` in light and `#FF8A3D` in dark), violet, amber, teal and sky from the base set. Drop coral, it is too close to orange and has the weakest contrast. Drop the home page blue, lime and light blue. Orange is the default accent when a screen needs one and none is chosen.

2. Contrast. Do not rely on components remembering to use the muted accent colour. For every accent in light theme there is a darker accent text shade that passes 4.5 to 1 on its wash and on the page background, marked as an extension. The site's exact accent colours are for headings and large text only. Rule for the skill: any small text in an accent uses `accent-text-aa`, never `accent-text`.

3. The handoff file wins. Where the tokens and `PORTFOLIO_HANDOFF.md` differ, the handoff is right. The changes made are listed in `design-system/tokens/SOURCES.md`.
